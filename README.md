# Country_clusters Dataset Analysis

## Overview
This repository contains the python code and documentation for analyzing the "Country_cluster" dataset using
 Python and statistical methods. The dataset consists of various variables related to country, latitude, longitude, language.
Our goal is to explore, analyze, and draw insights from this data.

## Dataset Description
The "Country_clusters" dataset contains information about Language, represents the latitude and longitude. Each entry represents a unique 
dining experience and includes the following columns:
